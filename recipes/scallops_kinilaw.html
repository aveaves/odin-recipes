    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      An acidic marinade is all that is needed to cook this spicy and sour
      kinilaw na scallops. You can also serve the scallops on toasted sesame
      crackers. As with all kinilaws, the acidic marinade "cooks" the seafood
      without heat-and it happens pretty quickly. So it's good to make this at
      the last minute and set it out just before people dig in.
